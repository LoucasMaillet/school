# Project C.H.I.P.S

Just a small videogame which concept is based on "the story where you are the hero".

We didn't have a budget for the story so the main quest is to get chips. - The Storywritter.

PS: This project is half-based on another project called [tkyml](https://github.com/LoucasMaillet/tkyml) used to build fast an understandable tkinter interface.

## Warning

The game isn't cross-platform, indeed it should only work on windows machine due to some tkinter trick (see more why on).

# Install

First you need to [install python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your environnement.
Then open a terminal in here and run `python3 -m pip install -r src/requirements.txt` to install the required packages.

# Run

For that you can either use the simple `run.cmd` file to start the game, or you can call it yourself from anywhere, the main file being `src/main.pyw` (just make sure to use `python 3.11`)
